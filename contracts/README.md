## ESG PROPOSAL README

### TO RUN: COMPILE TREASURY.SOL

##### Group Members: Willie Sine & Sam Navias Project 

##### Recently ESG investing has gained widespread popularity amongst large firms in the finance industry. The goal of ESG investing is for large cap investment firms to provide huge sums of capital to companies building products and services with the goal of promoting technologies that reduce the harmful impacts of humanity on the environment.  The only problem with this approach is that the only ones who gain financial benefits from ESG firms that make profits are the initial large cap investors.  Our approach for the project would be to create a platform where individuals and firms alike could contribute to said platform by sharing ideas and technologies that would help reduce the population's carbon footprint.  The platform could receive funding from all sorts of individuals through capital injections via ethereum and as a result the individual investors would hold a stake in the platform.  If any products or ideas existing on the platform were able to generate revenue the profits will be distributed to all of the investors who gave ETH to fund the platform.
